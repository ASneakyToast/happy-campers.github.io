#### Woke up to more water
Still the same single drops from the air conditioner and now below the front window feels super wet. Since some of our windows don't open/close (like that one) there's a slight crash for water to get through. We might throw the tarp over is and wait the rain out to fix things once it's dry.

#### Snow walk
Went on a snow walk.
