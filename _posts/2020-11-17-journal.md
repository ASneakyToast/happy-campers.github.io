#### Car mechanic
Went to our mechanic in El Cerrito to get the car checked out again. Ended up being nothing but some ghost codes from the last job.

#### New tires
Stopped at an America's Tires and swapped out the trailer wheels for some new endurance ones. We got a crazy deal on them too!

#### A leak
Since it was raining all day while we were driving we didn't notice that water was getting in through the air conditioner. Although it seems to have stopped or cut back alot now, we hope to fix this tomorrow by covering any exposed ventilation.

#### First snow!
We found snow along the road at our campsite at mt. Shasta. Our first with the trailer.

#### Fridge problems
Back to not being able to ignite the fridge... hopefully it's fixed after we level the trailer tomorrow and before our for food goes bad.
